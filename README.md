# GSOC-23-Proposals
Finally I have cracked the **Google Summer of Code**. I got selected in **SymPy**.

This repository has proposals that I submitted in **Google Summer Of Code' 23**. I would like to share my proposals for reference and further improvements in the following projects. I had submitted 3 proposals and will be sharing the 2 that got rejected.


# Python Software Foundation (Sub org. - Lpython)
My aim for these proposals is that they help and provide a fundamental base for developers interested in the following project. Keep in my mind these proposals 
did not make the cut. So the entire set of ideas and work proposed in these proposals is helpful. I will be working on my selected project this summer and encourage anyone to feel free to go through the proposals and draw ideas to implement in **Lpython**.

1.**Implementing Modules from Python Standard Library** -
